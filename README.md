# Computer Graphics Project
This project was developed for the subject of Computer Graphics. A basic pipeline of 3D image rendering is implemented and the algorithms are tested using basic data files.
To view the stages of the pipeline you can execute the `demo.py` files present in each directory.

Alongside with the code, each directory also contains a `report.pdf` file that analyses everything that was used.
